Captstone project #1 for HarvardX PH125.9x Data Science : Capstone, the final course in the Data Science Professional Certificate series. This project builds upon a recommendation system built during the previous course, PH125.8x Data Science : Machine Learning and requires the student to include additional variables into the model to sufficiently improve the RMSE below a certain threshold.
